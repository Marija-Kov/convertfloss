<p align="center"> 
In this HTML, CSS and JavaScript application I created a chart conversion used by embroidery professionals to convert floss (a.k.a. threads) from one brand to another. It can also be used to find a specific color and look for the code companies use for them. All the data comes from a JSON file created by myself and stored within the data folder.</p>
